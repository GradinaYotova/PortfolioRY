          In the past time was visualised in a circular form, as a closed cycle, happening over and over again. The passage of time was observed mostly in nature and the passage of the seasons.<br>
          With the development of the transport and the modernisation of the world, life became faster, respectively people began to need more precise ways to keep track of the time. Time became an infinite horizontal with no beginning, and no end.<br>
          Loop 21 is an alternative way to keeping track of time. With this project I want to bring back the audience to the natural flow of time passage.

          Existence & Belonging: Molding Social Clichés is a project focused on the relation between national identity and exoticism in our globalised society. The concept of the exotic became fundamental in the 19th century when modern tourism started to exist as we know it today. Exoticism is considered to be the representation of one culture for consumption by another. In many ways modern tourism has always been organised around the stereotypical understandings of the “other”. Crossing beyond political or cultural borders provokes the tourist to recreate variety of stories for the “other”, interpret in many different ways.
