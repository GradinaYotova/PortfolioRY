      <p class="info">
        On the Social Affects of Communication Design is an exploration about the photomontage medium and the degree to which it can be used as an activist form of expression.
        It was inspired by the American artists Martha Rosler, and her series of images “House Beautiful: bringing the war home”.<br>
        The project was a collaboration with Nerile Rickute, who worked on the typographical part, while I worked on the visual essay.<br>
        - This project was guided by Els Kuijpers.
